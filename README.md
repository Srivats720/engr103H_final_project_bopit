# engr103H_final_project_bopit
My final project is recreating Bop It using the Arduino CPX board. I will be using the buttons and the accelerometer to get inputs from the players. The player has to give
the correct input based on the given command. 
1) The LED lights will turn pink, representing the "Bop it" command. The player has to hit the right button before the LED light turns off to earn a point
2) The LED light will turn yellow, representing the "twist it" command. The player has to shake the CPX board before the LED light turns off
3) The LED light will turn purple, representing the "pull it" command. The player has to press both buttons before the LED lights turn off

When the player correctly executes each of the commands, the score will increment, and as the score gets higher, the speed at which the LED light turns off will increase.

2 players can play this game, so the high score of both players will be scored after the end of the game and displayed before the game starts
